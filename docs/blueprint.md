## Core Features:

- Initial Onboarding Question: Onboarding flow that asks initial question about personal or work purchases.
- Dynamic Question Generation: AI-powered tool that generates 3-5 follow-up questions based on the user's initial answer in the onboarding flow, and the answers given to prior questions. These questions will help to determine user needs for best results.
- Search Bar: A prominent search bar allows users to directly input their desired product or service.
- Intelligent Search Agent: An intelligent agent tool scours the internet for the best product options based on the search query and user profile data. The agent considers criteria such as price, quality, availability, and user preferences (gleaned via the onboarding questions) when deciding which result would be best for the user.
- Product Recommendation List: A curated list of 3-5 top product recommendations are displayed with clear justification as to why each is the 'best' option based on price, features, and relevance to the user's profile and search.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming desaturated blue (#8DBDD8) to inspire confidence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern feel.
- Accent color: A soft teal (#78B8B0) to highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Nunito', a clean sans-serif, is used for both headers and body text.
- Employ a modern layout that emphasizes simplicity and ease of navigation. Use whitespace effectively to ensure that product recommendations are not cluttered and easily digestible.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user interactions. For example, the loading of search results or transitions between screens.
- Apply a glassmorphism effect for elements like search bars and card backgrounds, creating a frosted glass appearance. Buttons should utilize a neomorphism effect, with soft, extruded shapes.
